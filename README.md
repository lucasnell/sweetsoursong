# A Song of Sweet and Sour (Nectar)

This repo contains the R package `sweetsoursong` that simulates metacommunities
of nectar microbes with effects on pollinator visitations to plants.
It also contains scripts (many of which use the R package) that are used to
create figures in the manuscript *Dispersalâ€“community feedback can promote 
regional coexistence despite priority effects*.
